#AngularJS Skeleton app

This is a bootstrap of an angular application using :
+ [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
+ [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)
+ [coffeescript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript)
+ [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus)
+ [jade template](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)
+ [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
+ [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

## Building
For compiling/building the app just run this command.
    
    $ gulp


## This is only a skeleton
This is only a skeleton app. The workflow is working but the modules are empty. It will help you to have a nice files structure to follow and a ready to use build system.
